Ripples (WIP)

Ripples asks a simple question: What if the ground could respond to us?

This interactive installation invites people to pause, notice, and engage with the textures underfoot â€” turning overlooked surfaces into responsive, playful canvases. The project is still in progress, evolving through prototypes that experiment with scale, sensors, and light.

ðŸŒ± Current Concept & Phases

Phase 1 â€” Single Ripple
The first prototype tested the concept with a single, animated ripple responding to a touch input. This phase helped establish the basic visual language and responsiveness of the interaction.

Phase 2 â€” DIY Touchscreen Grid
Building on the first prototype, a grid of seven capacitive touch sensors (the maximum available at the time) created a simple, tiled surface where each zone triggered its own ripple effect. This phase explored how multiple points of interaction could coexist and overlap.

Phase 3 â€” Large-Scale Immersive Ground
The current phase aims to scale the project into a room-sized, immersive installation using distance sensors and Adafruit LED lighting embedded into the floor. This iteration will allow visitors to move freely and create ripples across the space, bringing the concept closer to its intended experiential form.

ðŸ§° Technologies (so far)

Capacitive touch sensors (7)
Distance sensors (planned)
Adafruit LEDs (planned)
Arduino & Processing for interaction mapping and animation

ðŸš§ Status

The project is currently in Phase 3 â€” prototyping sensor configurations and refining the light animations for large-scale deployment. Updates and additional code will be added here as progress continues.
